Love?
Anonymous

*** Top-To-Bottom ***

I don't love you anymore...
I would be lying if I said
That I still love you the way I always did.
I'm sure
Nothing was in vain.
And I feel inside of me that
You mean nothing to me
I could never really say that
Our time together matters.
I feel more and more that
I'm forgetting you...
And I will never use the phrase
I love you.
I'm sorry but I must tell the truth...
